# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## ShareKit - Lead Magnet Delivery Platform

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025  
**Product Name:** ShareKit  
**Domain:** sharekit.net  
**Tagline:** "Share what matters"  
**Target Launch:** 14 days from approval

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Product Vision
ShareKit is a micro-SaaS platform that enables course creators, coaches, and consultants to effortlessly share their digital resources (PDFs, checklists, guides) through beautiful landing pages that capture emails and deliver content automatically—without the complexity and cost of full email marketing platforms.

### 1.2 Brand Positioning
**"Share what matters"**

ShareKit positions content as valuable resources to *share* (generous, giving) rather than "lead magnets to capture" (transactional, marketing-heavy). The brand emphasizes the creator's generosity and the value they're providing, making both creators and downloaders feel good about the exchange.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
**Current Pain Points:**
- ConvertKit/Mailchimp cost $29-79/month but creators only need freebie delivery
- Setting up landing pages + email automation takes 2-3 hours
- Creators waste money on unused features (complex automation, CRM, A/B testing)
- Many lose leads due to complicated setup processes
- Tools feel "corporate" and "marketing-heavy" rather than generous

**Target Customer Quote:**
*"I just want to share my free guide with people who want it. Why do I need to learn email automation and pay $30/month?"*

### 1.4 Solution
ShareKit does ONE thing exceptionally well: beautiful landing pages → capture emails → deliver digital resources → track performance. No bloat, no complexity, no "funnel builder" jargon.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Generous by default:** Language focuses on "sharing" not "capturing"
- **Beautifully simple:** 5-minute setup, not 2-hour courses
- **Respectful:** No dark patterns, clear unsubscribe, privacy-first

### 1.5 Success Metrics (Updated)
- **30 paying customers** in first 30 days ($450-750 MRR)
- **100 paying customers** by month 3 ($1,500-2,500 MRR)
- **>20% conversion rate** from landing page visitor to email signup (industry avg: 12%)
- **<5% churn rate** monthly
- **Average time to first share:** <8 minutes

---

## 2. BRAND IDENTITY & VOICE

### 2.1 Brand Personality

**ShareKit is:**
- **Generous:** We celebrate sharing knowledge, not extracting value
- **Approachable:** Simple enough for non-tech creators
- **Encouraging:** We support creators in growing their impact
- **Honest:** No manipulation, no dark patterns, no spam

**ShareKit is NOT:**
- Salesy or aggressive
- Complex or technical
- Corporate or impersonal
- Jargon-heavy ("funnels," "sequences," "conversion optimization")

### 2.2 Voice & Tone Guidelines

**Word Choices:**
| ✅ Use | ❌ Avoid |
|--------|----------|
| Share your guide | Deliver your lead magnet |
| Your resources | Your freebies |
| People who download | Leads/prospects |
| Create a page | Build a funnel |
| Send them your guide | Capture emails |
| Grow your community | Build your list |

**Example Copy:**
```
Bad (Marketing-Heavy):
"Convert visitors into leads with high-converting landing pages"

Good (ShareKit Voice):
"Share your best content with people who'll love it"

---

Bad:
"Capture emails and nurture leads through automated sequences"

Good:
"Send your guide and stay connected with people who download it"
```

### 2.3 Visual Identity

**Logo Concept:**
- Wordmark: "ShareKit" in clean, modern sans-serif (Outfit font)
- Icon: Overlapping circles or connected nodes (representing sharing/connection)
- Alternative: Open hand offering/giving gesture

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** Ocean Blue `#0891B2` (Cyan 600) - Trustworthy, professional, calming
- **Secondary:** Sky Blue `#0EA5E9` (Sky 500) - Friendly, approachable
- **Accent:** Amber `#F59E0B` (Amber 500) - Warm CTA buttons
- **Success:** Emerald `#10B981` (Emerald 500) - Positive actions
- **Neutral:** Slate scale - Modern, clean backgrounds
- **Background:** White `#FFFFFF` with subtle Slate 50 `#F8FAFC` sections

**Typography:**
- **Headings:** Outfit (Google Fonts) - Rounded, friendly, modern
- **Body:** Inter (Google Fonts) - Clean, highly readable
- **Monospace:** Fira Code - For code snippets, URLs

**Design Principles:**
- **White space:** Generous spacing, never cramped
- **Rounded corners:** 8-12px radius for warmth
- **Subtle shadows:** Soft elevation, not harsh
- **Clear hierarchy:** Typography scale, color contrast
- **Mobile-first:** Perfect on phones, great on desktop

### 2.4 Messaging Framework

**Homepage Hero:**
```
Headline: "Share what matters"
Subheadline: "Beautiful pages that deliver your guides, 
checklists, and resources to people who want them"
CTA: "Start sharing free" / "See how it works"
```

**Feature Headlines:**
- Not: "High-Converting Landing Pages"
- **But:** "Beautiful pages in 5 minutes"

- Not: "Email Capture Forms"
- **But:** "Simple signup, instant delivery"

- Not: "Analytics Dashboard"
- **But:** "See who's downloading"

**Customer Testimonials (Target Tone):**
- *"I set up my first resource page in 3 minutes. No tech skills needed."*
- *"Finally, a tool that doesn't make me feel like a sleazy marketer."*
- *"My clients love how clean and professional my resource pages look."*

**Partnerships:**
- Course platforms (Teachable, Thinkific) - integration

- Productivity influencers (sponsorships)

**Paid Advertising:**
- Facebook Ads: Target "online course creator" "life coach"

- Twitter Ads: Promoted tweets to creator audience
- Budget: $500/month initially

**Referral Program:**
- Give $10, Get $10 credit

- Automatic tracking and payouts

**Email Marketing:**
```
Welcome Sequence (5 emails):
1. Welcome + quick start guide

4. Advanced tips: Improve conversion rates
5. Upgrade prompt: Pro features

Weekly Newsletter:
- Creator tips
- Feature updates
- Success stories
- Community highlights
```

### 8.5 Pricing Psychology

**Free Trial Strategy:**
- Start on Free plan (no credit card)
- After 100 signups reached: "Upgrade to continue"
- Upgrade prompt: "You're growing! Time for Pro"
- Email at 80, 90, 100 signups

**Conversion Tactics:**
- Show "Shared with ShareKit" branding prominently
- "Remove branding" as upgrade trigger
- "You've used 45/100 signups this month" progress bar
- Annual plan discount (save 20%)
- Limited-time launch offer (50% off first month)

**Objection Handling:**
```
"Too expensive"
→ Compare: ConvertKit $29/mo, ShareKit $19/mo
→ Calculator: "Save $120/year"

"Why not use Google Drive?"
→ Professional branding
→ Email capture
→ Analytics

"I'll just use ConvertKit"
→ "If you only need resource delivery, you're overpaying"
→ "ShareKit does one thing better"
```

## 14. CONCLUSION

ShareKit is positioned to become the go-to platform for coaches, consultants, and course creators who want to share their expertise generously without the complexity of enterprise email tools.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Brand Positioning:** "Share" language resonates with generous creators
2. **Simplicity:** 5-minute setup vs hours of ConvertKit configuration
3. **Affordability:** $19/mo vs $29-79/mo competitors
4. **Focus:** Does one thing exceptionally well
5. **Beautiful Design:** Professional templates out-of-the-box

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Review and approve this PRD
2. Register domain: sharekit.net
3. Set up GitHub repository
4. Create Supabase project
5. Begin Day 1 development

**Questions for Stakeholder (Dan):**
1. Approved to proceed with development?
2. Any changes to feature priorities?
3. Budget confirmed for Stripe/Resend/Supabase?
4. Who handles customer support (you or automate)?
5. Marketing launch date target?
