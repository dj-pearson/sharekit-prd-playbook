Terms of Service
Last Updated: November 11, 2025
Introduction
Welcome to ShareKit. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the ShareKit platform, website, and services (“ShareKit” or the “Platform”). By signing up for an account or using ShareKit in any way, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use ShareKit. “You” refers to you as a user of the Platform (including both content creators and anyone accessing shared content), and “we” or “us” refers to the ShareKit service provider.
ShareKit is a U.S.-based Software-as-a-Service platform that enables creators, coaches, and consultants to upload digital files (such as PDFs, guides, checklists) and share them via landing pages[1]. Our aim is to help you deliver resources to your audience easily, while protecting us from legal liability related to user-uploaded content. Please read these Terms carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities.
Eligibility and Account Registration
* Minimum Age: You must be at least 13 years old to use ShareKit, and at least 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to create an account or purchase any paid services. By using ShareKit, you represent that you meet these age requirements. We do not knowingly allow children under 13 to use the Platform or collect their personal data (see Privacy Policy for more details on Children’s Privacy).
* Account Information: When you register, you agree to provide truthful, current, and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately at support@sharekit.net if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or security breach. You must not share your password or allow others to use your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your credentials.
* Account Use: You agree to use ShareKit only for legitimate purposes. If you are using ShareKit on behalf of a company or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You are responsible for any activity on your account, whether or not authorized by you, until you close or report misuse of your account.
User Content and Ownership
* Your Content: “User Content” means any content that you upload, transmit, or store on ShareKit, including but not limited to digital files, documents, text, images, and email communications you send through the Platform. You retain all rights to your User Content. We do not claim ownership of the content you provide to ShareKit. However, by uploading or sharing content on the Platform, you grant ShareKit a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, and distribute your content solely for the purpose of operating the service and fulfilling your requests (for example, to display your landing page and deliver your file to users who request it). This license ends when you delete the content from our servers, except to the extent it has been shared with others and they have not deleted it, or it has been stored as part of routine backups.
* Your Responsibility for Content: You are solely responsible for all User Content that you upload or share via ShareKit[2]. This means you must ensure your content and your use of the Platform comply with these Terms and all applicable laws. We do not routinely monitor or edit user-uploaded content, and we are not responsible for its appropriateness, legality, or accuracy. However, we reserve the right to remove or disable access to any content at our discretion if we believe it violates these Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy, or the law. We also may suspend or terminate accounts associated with such content. You understand that any content you share through ShareKit may be viewed or downloaded by others with whom you share your landing page link. ShareKit is not responsible for what recipients do with the content you provide.
* Prohibited Content and Activities: You agree not to use ShareKit for any improper or unlawful purposes. Specifically (and without limitation), you must not upload, share, or use the service to distribute any content that:
* Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or other rights of any person or entity (including content to which you do not hold the necessary rights or licenses).
* Contains viruses, malware, or any code intended to harm or disrupt the software, hardware, or security of ShareKit or any user.
* Is illegal, abusive, harassing, threatening, defamatory, obscene, pornographic (including any content involving minors, which is strictly prohibited), or otherwise objectionable or harmful (for example, hate speech or content that incites violence).
* Violates privacy or data protection rights of others, such as by disclosing personal information of individuals without consent.
* Constitutes unauthorized advertising, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of solicitation. You may not use ShareKit’s email delivery features to send unsolicited bulk emails or communications that violate the CAN-SPAM Act (e.g., you must not send emails without proper consent, and you must include a valid opt-out method)[3].
* Attempts to impersonate any person or entity, or falsely states or misrepresents your identity or affiliation.
* Attempts to gain unauthorized access to ShareKit, our systems, or other users’ accounts or data, or to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network related to the Platform.
* Attempts to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract our source code, or to circumvent any security or access controls of ShareKit.
* Uses ShareKit in a manner that could interfere with, disrupt, or create undue burden on the Platform or the networks or services connected to the Platform (for example, using automated scripts to mass-download content, or other excessive usage that impacts service performance).
These examples are further detailed in our Acceptable Use Policy (see below), which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Violation of any of the above may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account, removal of prohibited content, and potential legal action where appropriate.
Acceptable Use Policy
Our Acceptable Use Policy provides a comprehensive list of allowed and disallowed activities on ShareKit. By using ShareKit, you agree to abide by the rules outlined in that policy at all times. We have a zero-tolerance stance toward harmful or unlawful content and activities. If you witness or experience any content or behavior that violates our policies, please report it as described under “Content Reporting” below.
Content Reporting and Enforcement
* Reporting Violations: ShareKit takes the integrity of the Platform seriously. If you discover content that you believe violates these Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy, or is otherwise illegal or harmful, please notify us immediately. You can report abuse by emailing abuse@sharekit.net or support@sharekit.net with a description of the issue and a link to the content or user in question. We have a mechanism to review and respond to such reports promptly.
* Our Response: We reserve the right to investigate any alleged violation of these Terms or our policies. We may remove or disable access to any content or accounts that we find violate our rules or applicable law. In serious cases (such as content involving child exploitation or threats of violence), we may report the matter to law enforcement. We are not required to return removed content to you. If your content is removed or your account is suspended/terminated, we will, where reasonably possible, notify you of the action and the reason (unless the notification is prohibited by law or we determine in our good faith that doing so could result in legal liability or harm to others).
* No Pre-Screening: ShareKit is a platform for user-generated content. As such, we generally do not pre-screen content before it is posted. We rely on users to adhere to these Terms and on community reporting to flag issues. You acknowledge that there may be content accessible through ShareKit that you find offensive or that violates your rights. Use caution and discretion when accessing content through shared links. We are not liable for content provided by users, but we will act to remove infringing or violating content once we are aware of it.
Intellectual Property Rights
* ShareKit’s Intellectual Property: Apart from your content, all other materials on the Platform, including the ShareKit name, logos, trademarks, branding, software code, and design, are owned by or licensed to us and are protected by intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform and any provided tools or software as intended for your personal or internal business use. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our intellectual property, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract our source code, except as permitted by law. Any feedback or suggestions you provide regarding ShareKit may be used by us without obligation to you.
* Your Intellectual Property: You must only upload content that you have the right to share. By uploading content, you represent and warrant that you own or have obtained all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to lawfully share the content and to grant us the limited license above. You also promise that your content and the sharing of it via ShareKit will not violate any third-party rights (including copyrights, trademarks, privacy, or publicity rights) or any laws. You agree to indemnify us (meaning you will defend and hold us harmless) for any costs, claims, or liabilities arising from your content. This means if your content causes a legal dispute (for example, someone claims it infringes their copyright or contains illegal material), you will be responsible for the costs and damages we suffer due to that dispute (see “Indemnification” below for more details).
DMCA Copyright Policy
We respect copyright law and expect you to do the same. If you believe that content on ShareKit infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a DMCA Takedown Notice. Our separate DMCA Policy provides instructions on how to submit a proper notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In summary, the notice should include information such as a description of the copyrighted work, the location of the infringing material on our Platform, your contact information, and certain statements under penalty of perjury[4][5]. Upon receiving a valid DMCA notice, we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content and notify the user who posted it. That user then has the option to send us a Counter Notification if they believe a takedown was mistaken (the counter-notice must include specific information as described in our DMCA Policy)[6]. We will follow the DMCA’s procedures for such counter notices, including restoring content if appropriate after 10 business days, unless the original complainant informs us they have filed a court action[7]. Repeat copyright infringers will have their accounts terminated in appropriate circumstances[8]. Please refer to the DMCA Policy for full details.
Privacy and Data Protection
Your privacy is very important to us. Our Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect from you and your end-users, and how we use, share, and protect it. By using ShareKit, you acknowledge that you have read the Privacy Policy and agree to ShareKit’s data practices, including the collection and handling of your information in accordance with that policy. In particular, if you are a content creator using ShareKit to collect email addresses or other data from people who request your content, you agree to handle that data lawfully. This includes complying with privacy laws (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA, and if applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR) when you export, use, or otherwise process the personal data of your subscribers. You should only email or contact people who have given you consent to do so, and you must provide a clear way for them to unsubscribe from future emails (the Platform will assist by including an unsubscribe link in automated emails by default, in compliance with CAN-SPAM requirements)[9]. You agree not to misuse any personal data obtained through ShareKit, and you understand that ShareKit is not liable for your relationships or communications with your subscribers outside of the Platform’s functionality.
Payments, Subscriptions, and Refunds
(If you are using any paid features of ShareKit or subscribing to a paid plan, the following terms apply to you.)
- Fees and Billing: ShareKit may offer both free and paid subscription plans. If you subscribe to a paid plan, you agree to pay all applicable fees, which will be charged on a periodic basis (e.g., monthly or annually) as described at the time of purchase. Prices are stated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified. Any taxes or duties payable in your jurisdiction are your responsibility (we will collect taxes where required by law). You authorize ShareKit (or our third-party payment processor, such as Stripe) to charge your provided payment method for the recurring subscription fee and any other applicable charges. If your payment fails or cannot be processed, we may suspend or cancel your access to paid features.
- Automatic Renewal: Unless otherwise noted, subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or annually) at the then-current rate, unless you cancel beforehand. You can cancel renewal by visiting your account settings or contacting support. If you cancel, you will retain access to paid features until the end of your current paid term, and your subscription will not renew thereafter.
- Refund Policy: Payments are generally non-refundable. We provide digital services that begin immediately upon purchase, so we do not typically offer refunds for subscription fees already paid. For example, if you cancel your subscription in the middle of a month, the cancellation will take effect at the next billing cycle and you will not receive a mid-period refund. However, we want you to be satisfied with ShareKit, so if you believe there has been a billing error or you are unsatisfied due to a technical issue on our part, please contact us at billing@sharekit.net. In some cases, at our sole discretion, we may provide a pro rata refund or credit. Any refund policy specific to ShareKit (such as a first-time satisfaction guarantee or promotional refund offer) will be detailed in our Refund Policy section below. We also comply with any refund rights that consumers have under applicable laws.
- Upgrades and Downgrades: If you upgrade your plan (e.g., from a free to a paid plan, or to a higher tier), your billing may adjust immediately to the new rate, and the change may take effect immediately (with any prorated charges or credits as appropriate). If you downgrade a plan, you may lose access to features or capacity that were available under your previous plan, and such changes will apply after your current billing period ends (we generally do not provide refunds for a downgrade during an ongoing period). Please review the plan details and pricing carefully before making changes.
- Payment Processing: We use third-party payment processors (like Stripe) to handle payment transactions. These processors have their own terms and privacy policies, which apply to your payments. ShareKit itself does not store your full credit card details; sensitive payment information is securely handled by the payment processor. We are not responsible for errors or security breaches by these third-party processors, but we will work to resolve any issues within our power.
- Failed Payments: If a charge is declined or your payment method is otherwise not successful, we may attempt to charge again or notify you to provide a new payment method. If payment remains uncollected, we may downgrade or suspend your account for non-payment. You are responsible for keeping your billing information up to date.
- Trials and Promotions: If we offer a free trial or introductory offer, you must cancel before the trial ends to avoid being charged. After the trial, you will be charged the applicable subscription fee unless you cancel. Any promotional discounts apply only for the specified term; after that, normal fees will apply.
Transactions Between Creators and End Users
ShareKit’s role is to provide the platform for sharing digital content. If you (a creator) offer content (whether free or paid) to end users via ShareKit, any relationship or transaction that arises is solely between you and the end user. ShareKit is not a party to any sale or contract between you and those who download or receive your content, except to the limited extent that ShareKit processes payments on your behalf for paid content (if such functionality is enabled) and delivers the content. Content creators are responsible for setting their own terms with their customers (for example, any license or usage terms for the digital file, or any refund policy for a paid product). ShareKit does not control, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the quality, legality, or delivery of user-offered content beyond providing the technical service. We do not mediate disputes between you and your customers, and we will not provide refunds to your customers on your behalf. As a creator, you agree to indemnify ShareKit for any claims arising out of your offerings or interactions with end users. As an end user obtaining content, you acknowledge that the content is provided by the creator and not by ShareKit, and that any claims or issues with the content should be directed to the creator.
Disclaimers of Warranties
ShareKit is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. While we strive to provide a great service, we make no warranties or guarantees that ShareKit will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, or that it will meet your expectations or requirements. Use of the Platform is at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, ShareKit disclaims all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to any implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or availability. We do not guarantee that any content (including your User Content) will be preserved or maintained without loss. We do not warrant that ShareKit will help you achieve any specific results (for example, we do not guarantee that you will gain any particular number of leads, downloads, or sales by using our service). Any guidance, tutorials, or support we provide are for informational purposes and do not constitute a warranty or guarantee.
In summary, no advice or information obtained from ShareKit or its team shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. If applicable law does not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties, then those warranties are not disclaimed and are limited in duration to the minimum period permitted by law.
Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will ShareKit or its founders, owners, employees, affiliates, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Platform or any content on the Platform[10]. This includes, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, computer damage, or other intangible losses, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. ShareKit will not be liable for any content (including your content or other users’ content) that is defamatory, offensive, or illegal, or for the conduct of any third party. In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of certain damages, our liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Cap on Liability: To the extent permitted by law, our total liability to you for any claim arising from or related to the use of ShareKit is limited to the amount you have paid to us for the service in the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the liability, or $100 USD**, whichever is greater (or such lesser amount as may be mandated by applicable law)[11]. If you have paid us nothing, our total liability shall not exceed $100. This overall cap applies to all claims of any kind, whether based in contract, tort, or any other legal theory.
Exceptions: Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded under law. In particular, if a law applies to you that prohibits any of the limitations above, then to the extent required by that law, those limitations will not apply to you. However, in such cases, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ShareKit and its officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your access to or use of the Platform, (b) your User Content, (c) your violation of any of these Terms or any policy incorporated into these Terms, or (d) your violation of any law or the rights of any third party. This means that if a third party (including, for example, another user, a copyright holder, or a government agency) brings a claim against ShareKit related to your content or your use of the service, you will be responsible for any costs or damages we incur. We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, including choosing our counsel, and you agree to cooperate with us in the defense of any such claim.
Termination of Service
* By You: You may stop using ShareKit at any time. You may also delete your account by following the instructions in your account settings or contacting us at support@sharekit.net. Deleting your account will generally remove your profile and content from the Platform, but note that content you shared publicly or with others may continue to exist (for example, if someone downloaded a file you shared, we cannot delete the file from their possession). We may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (see our Privacy Policy for data retention details).
* By Us: We may suspend or terminate your access to ShareKit (or terminate these Terms with respect to you) at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. However, if we terminate your account without cause, we will typically provide a pro-rated refund of any prepaid subscription fees covering the remaining period (if applicable). Termination for cause (for example, due to your violation of these Terms or applicable law) will not require any refund. Causes for termination may include, without limitation: (i) breach of these Terms or any policy, (ii) extended periods of inactivity, (iii) our decision to discontinue the service or a portion of it, or (iv) technical or security issues.
* Effect of Termination: Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Platform will immediately cease. We may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all associated data and content, or we may retain it for a period of time for backup or audit purposes. We will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of your account or access to the service. If you have an ongoing subscription, termination by us (not due to your misconduct) will end your access and we will refund any unused portion of your subscription. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as intellectual property provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and governing law) will survive.
Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of ShareKit will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles[12]. We choose Delaware law as a neutral jurisdiction commonly used for U.S. businesses. If you reside outside the U.S., you acknowledge that your use of the Platform may subject you to U.S. laws.
Jurisdiction and Venue: You agree that any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the State of Delaware, USA, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. (If you are a consumer residing in a jurisdiction that would not permit this choice of venue – for example, if local consumer protection laws give you the right to bring claims in your home region – that provision may not apply to you.)
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration (Optional): If ShareKit chooses to include an arbitration clause or informal dispute resolution clause, it would be stated here. (For example, we might require that disputes be resolved by binding arbitration and waive class actions, but such a clause is not included here unless specified.) For now, any disputes will be handled in court as stated above.
Changes to These Terms
We may update or modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email (to the address associated with your account) or by posting a notice on our website or within the Platform. The notice will designate a reasonable advance notice period before the new Terms take effect, unless the changes are required by law to take effect sooner. By continuing to use ShareKit after any changes to the Terms become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Platform before the changes take effect and, if applicable, cancel your subscription. We encourage you to review the Terms periodically for any changes. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates the latest revision.
Miscellaneous
* Entire Agreement: These Terms (along with the Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, and any other policies or guidelines we link to or incorporate by reference) constitute the entire agreement between you and ShareKit regarding your use of the Platform, superseding any prior agreements between us on the subject. Any additional or different terms you seek to impose (for example, in correspondence) have no effect unless expressly agreed in writing by an authorized representative of ShareKit.
* Severability: If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
* No Waiver: Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by ShareKit.
* Assignment: You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or any rights or obligations in them) without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or by operation of law or otherwise, and you hereby consent to such assignment. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns.
* Relationship: These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between you and ShareKit. You and ShareKit are independent contractors.
* Third-Party Services: If our Platform integrates or links to any third-party services (such as an email delivery service, analytics provider, or payment gateway), your use of those services may be subject to separate terms of the third party. We are not responsible for third-party services.
* Force Majeure: ShareKit will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, such as natural disasters, acts of government, war, cyberattacks, labor disputes, or Internet service failures.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated: November 11, 2025
Introduction
Your privacy is important to ShareKit. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from users of our platform (“ShareKit” or the “Platform”), how we use and share that information, and your rights and choices regarding your information. This Policy applies to all users, including content creators who use our service to share files, as well as individuals who visit ShareKit websites or interact with ShareKit landing pages to access content. By using ShareKit, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.
We aim to use clear, simple language – but if you have any questions about our data practices, you can always contact us at privacy@sharekit.net.
Information We Collect
We collect information in several ways: information you provide to us directly, information collected automatically through technology, and information we receive from third parties (like service providers). The types of information we collect include:
* Account Information: When you sign up for a ShareKit account (as a creator or user), we collect personal information such as your name, email address, and password (passwords are stored in a hashed form). You may also choose to provide additional profile details, like a display name or profile photo, but these are optional. If you contact our support or communicate with us, we will collect the information you provide in those interactions (like your contact details and the content of your messages).
* Content and Files: If you are a creator uploading digital files or resources to share, we store those files (and associated details like file names, descriptions, etc.) for the purpose of providing the service. Similarly, if you create landing pages or enter text (like descriptions or welcome messages for your content), that information is stored on our Platform. Note that the content you upload might itself contain personal information (for example, a PDF you share might have your contact info inside it), but we treat the entire file as “your content” which we process as you direct.
* Information from People Who Download or Sign Up for Content: A core feature of ShareKit is enabling creators to share resources through landing pages that capture emails and deliver content[1]. If you fill out a ShareKit landing page form to request or download a resource (for example, entering your name and email address to get a PDF), we collect the information you submit. Typically, this will include your email address and possibly your name or other fields the creator has configured (e.g., a phone number or company name, if the form requests it). We collect this information on behalf of the creator who offered the content. Important: if you are someone downloading content through ShareKit, your information will be shared with the creator (see “How We Share Information” below). The creator may have access to your email and other details you provided, and they may use that information to contact you or send you additional content. We encourage creators to respect privacy and use such information only for the purposes you consented to (for example, sending the requested resource or occasional related updates), but ShareKit does not control the creator’s subsequent use of your information outside our Platform. (In other words, we act as a service provider processing your data on the creator’s behalf for the initial content delivery, but the creator might separately use that data in their own marketing or business, subject to their privacy practices.)
* Payment Information: If you subscribe to a paid ShareKit plan or make any purchases through ShareKit, you will provide payment information. We use a third-party payment processor (such as Stripe) to handle credit card or financial transactions. When you enter your payment details (e.g., card number, billing address), that information is sent directly to the payment processor on our behalf; we do not store your full credit card number on our systems. We may store information like the last four digits of your card, card type, and expiration for reference, as well as records of your transactions (date, amount, product purchased). If you use Stripe or another processor, your payment information is also subject to their privacy policy. We do keep track of your subscription status, payments made, and any refunds or cancellations for customer service and accounting purposes.
* Automatically Collected Data: When you use ShareKit (whether you are a logged-in creator or a visitor to a landing page or our website), we and our third-party analytics providers may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of the Platform:
* Usage Data: We log usage information such as the pages or screens you view, the date and time of your visit, the referral URL (if you came from a link), and your interactions (e.g., clicking a download button, or if you opened an email sent via ShareKit). For example, we may track that a particular resource was downloaded X times, or that an email delivering a file was opened by Y% of recipients.
* Device and Technical Data: We collect data about the device and browser you use. This may include the IP address of your device, your device type (e.g., desktop or mobile), browser type and version, operating system, unique device identifiers, and general location information derived from your IP (e.g., city or country). We use IP addresses primarily for security (such as preventing fraudulent or malicious activity) and to infer location at a coarse level (we do not pinpoint your exact GPS location). We may also record and use your IP address to infer your time zone or to comply with legal requirements (for instance, to determine if we need to show cookie consent banners or other region-specific features).
* Cookies and Similar Technologies: ShareKit uses cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons or local storage) to provide and improve our service. For instance, we use cookies to keep you logged in to your account, to remember preferences, and to gather analytics about usage (see our separate Cookie Policy below for more details). Web beacons (tiny image files or tracking pixels) may be used in emails we send on behalf of creators (for example, in the content delivery email) to let the creator know if you opened the email. You can control or block cookies as described in the Cookie Policy and “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy.
* Third-Party Integrations: If ShareKit integrates with third-party services (for example, if in the future we allow you to sign in via Google or connect to an email marketing service), and you choose to connect such a service to ShareKit, we may receive certain information from that third party. For instance, if you signed in via a social network or OAuth provider, we might receive your name and email from them to create your account. If we integrate with an email newsletter service and you choose to export your collected emails there, we obviously would send that data to that service at your direction (that’s not so much us receiving data as sending it, but it involves third parties). Any third-party integration will only be connected with your explicit consent, and we will let you know what information may be exchanged. Once transferred, the third-party’s handling of your data is governed by their own privacy policy.
We do not knowingly collect “sensitive” personal data such as social security numbers, government ID numbers, financial account passwords, or biometric data. Please do not provide this kind of information on ShareKit. We also do not intentionally collect any personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 (or under the applicable age of consent in certain jurisdictions) has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such information. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.
How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information for the following purposes, and we rely on certain legal bases for processing as noted (for users in jurisdictions like the EU where legal bases matter):
* To Provide and Maintain the Service (Contractual necessity): We process data to operate the ShareKit platform and provide features to you. This includes using your information to:
* Create and manage user accounts (allowing you to register, log in, and use our dashboard).
* Host your content and facilitate sharing (storing files, generating landing pages, and delivering files to your audience via email or download link).
* Manage transactions (processing subscription payments, sending invoices or receipts, and handling renewals/cancellations).
* Send you important service communications: We might send confirmation emails, technical notifications, updates about changes to our service or policies, and security alerts. For example, if you sign up or request a password reset, we email you; or if there’s a significant change to our infrastructure that affects you, we might notify you.
* Provide customer support: If you reach out with questions or issues, we will use your information (like your contact info and support history) to assist you and resolve problems.
* To Facilitate Content Delivery and Communications on Behalf of Creators (Consent/Contractual): If you are a creator’s subscriber or someone who filled out a form to get a resource, we use the information you provided to deliver that service. For example, your email address will be used to send you the content you requested and possibly follow-up emails that are part of that creator’s use of ShareKit (e.g., a thank-you email or a short series of related tips if the creator set that up, though ShareKit’s initial version focuses on the one-time delivery unless expanded). We may also use your information to show the creator analytics (like that you opened the email or downloaded the file). This processing is done based on the consent you gave by requesting the content (and on the creator’s behalf under our contract with the creator).
* To Improve and Analyze the Service (Legitimate interests): We want to make ShareKit better, so we may use collected information to understand usage trends and user preferences. We analyze how users interact with our site and features, which content is popular, and where users encounter errors. For example, we might look at aggregated data on how many landing page visitors convert into sign-ups, or how response rates vary. We use analytics tools (which may use cookies and device IDs) to gather this information. This helps us debug issues, optimize the user experience, and guide our development decisions. Wherever possible, we use aggregated or anonymized data for analytics, and we don’t use personally identifying information for any automated decision that would have a legal or significant effect on you without human review.
* To Prevent Fraud and Ensure Security (Legitimate interests/legal obligation): We process certain information to keep ShareKit and its users safe. This includes monitoring for suspicious activity (like logins from unusual locations, or possible abusive usage patterns), detecting security incidents, and protecting against malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity. We may block IP addresses that appear to be abusing our service (e.g., a bot attempting to scrape content or send spam). We also may use your email or phone (if provided) to verify your identity or for multi-factor authentication if implemented. In some cases, we might be legally required to process data for security (for example, keeping logs of access to personal data or notifying users of data breaches if they occur).
* For Marketing and User Communications (Legitimate interests/consent): If you are a ShareKit user (especially a creator), we may use your contact information to send you newsletters or marketing communications about product updates, new features, tips for success, or promotions, but only if you have opted in to such communications or if it’s within the scope of what is allowed without explicit opt-in (e.g., for our existing customers in the U.S., we might send product update emails as these can be considered related to our existing relationship). You can always opt out of marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in those emails or contacting us. We do not sell or share your personal information with third-party advertisers for their own marketing. We may occasionally collaborate with partners (for example, an integration partner) on a webinar or promotion, in which case we would only share your info with those partners if you explicitly sign up and consent. If you follow us on social media or interact with our content, we might also engage with or advertise to you on those platforms, but that’s governed by those platforms’ terms.
* To Comply with Legal Requirements (Legal obligation): We may use and disclose information as required by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. For instance, to comply with accounting and tax requirements we keep transaction records; to comply with privacy laws, we may respond to user requests about their data; or if law enforcement presents a lawful subpoena or court order, we might have to provide data. We will also use your information to enforce our Terms of Service and other agreements, or to defend against legal claims. This might involve using data to investigate potential violations of our policies (for example, content that might infringe copyrights or involve fraud).
* With Your Consent: If we ever need to use your personal information for a purpose that is not covered by the above, we will explain the situation and ask for your consent before proceeding. For example, if we wanted to publish a user testimonial with your name and photo, we would ask your permission.
How We Share Information
We treat your personal information with care and do not sell it. However, we do share information in certain circumstances, as outlined here:
* With the Content Creator (for subscriber data): If you provide your information on a ShareKit landing page to access a creator’s content, we share that information with the creator who offered the content. For example, if you sign up with your name and email to get “Coach Alice’s Productivity Guide,” Coach Alice (the creator) will receive your name and email address (and any other info you submitted) so she knows who accessed her guide and can follow up with you. The creator may export that information or integrate it into their own systems (outside of ShareKit’s control). Creators are responsible for handling subscriber data in accordance with applicable laws. ShareKit only facilitates the initial collection and sharing of this data; we do not dictate what the creator does with it thereafter (though our Terms require them to use it lawfully and not misuse it). If you have concerns about how a creator uses your data, you will need to reach out to that creator directly. We can assist by providing contact info if needed.
* With Service Providers (Processors): We use trusted third-party companies to help us operate ShareKit and provide our services to you. These service providers perform tasks on our behalf and under our instructions (under data processing agreements) and include:
* Hosting and Infrastructure: We host our application and data on platforms such as Supabase (a Backend-as-a-Service built on PostgreSQL) and possibly other cloud providers. They store the databases, files, and authentication information needed for ShareKit to run[13][14].
* Email Delivery: We might use an email sending service (for example, an SMTP service or a service like SendGrid or Supabase’s email function) to send verification emails, notifications, and the content delivery emails on behalf of creators. These services would process recipients’ email addresses and the content of emails under our instructions.
* Payment Processing: As mentioned, if you are a paying customer, your payment is processed by third-party processors like Stripe[15]. They will receive payment details and transaction amounts. We share with them the necessary billing info (like your name, email, and billing address if needed) to process payments securely.
* Analytics: We may use analytics providers (such as Google Analytics or a privacy-focused alternative) to collect usage data and get reports on how users interact with our site. These providers set their own cookies or trackers to gather information (typically IP address, device info, site usage) which they aggregate for us. We use these insights to improve the product. We configure these tools not to collect unnecessary data, and where possible we enable settings to respect “Do Not Track” signals or cookie consent.
* Customer Support Tools: If we use any CRM or support ticket systems (like Zendesk, Intercom, or others), and you contact us, the information you provide (contact info, issue details) may be stored on those systems. They in turn have access to that data strictly to provide the service to us (e.g., to organize support conversations).
* Other Vendors: We could use other specialized vendors for things like error tracking (to log errors from the app), marketing (if we send newsletters via a service like MailChimp, though currently we might just use our own system or simple email), or data backups. We will ensure any such providers are bound to protect your data and only use it for the functions we require.
In all cases, we share with service providers only the information necessary for them to perform their functions, and we contractually require them to keep the information confidential and to use appropriate security measures. They are not allowed to use your data for their own purposes unrelated to providing the ShareKit service.
* Business Transfers: If ShareKit is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be disclosed to our successors or assigns (e.g., a new owner or successor of ShareKit) as part of that transaction. We would seek to ensure the new entity follows this Privacy Policy or provides notice if they intend to use your data differently. For example, if ShareKit, Inc. is acquired by BigTech Co., user information would likely be one of the assets transferred, but you would be notified and given choices as required by law.
* Legal Compliance and Protection: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:
* Comply with a legal obligation, such as responding to subpoenas, court orders, or lawful requests by government authorities.
* Protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of ShareKit, our users, or others. This can include enforcing our Terms of Service, investigating potential violations, detecting and preventing fraud or security issues.
* In an emergency, to protect the personal safety of individuals or the public. For example, if we believe someone is at risk of imminent harm, we might provide information to the authorities to help prevent it.
* Aggregate or De-Identified Data: We may also share information that has been aggregated or anonymized in such a way that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we might publish trend reports or case studies like “X% of ShareKit users saw a conversion increase after adjusting their landing page design,” or share aggregated stats about overall usage of the Platform. This information would not include personal data.
We do not sell personal information to third parties for monetary consideration. We also do not share personal information for targeted advertising purposes as defined under certain privacy laws (like we don’t give your email or device ID to third-party advertisers to target you on other sites). If that ever changes, we will update this policy and provide any necessary opt-outs.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies
ShareKit uses cookies and similar technologies to function effectively and to understand how our services are used. For detailed information, please read our Cookie Policy. In summary: - Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites you visit. We use essential cookies for things like logging you in (so you don’t have to enter credentials on every page) and remembering your preferences (like language). We also use analytical cookies to collect information about usage (as discussed in the analytics section above). We do not currently use advertising cookies or track you across different websites for ad targeting. - We may also use local storage or session storage for certain web app functionalities (similar to cookies, but stored in your browser’s storage space). - If we send emails, we might include a tiny image (beacon) to know if you opened it or if links were clicked, mainly to inform the creator about engagement. - You have choices: you can usually configure your browser to refuse some or all cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being set. However, note that if you disable cookies entirely, some features of ShareKit (like staying logged in) may not work properly. Our Cookie Policy explains how to adjust your settings and how to opt out of analytics tracking if available.
Data Retention
We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. For example: - We keep your account information while your account is active and for a reasonable period afterwards in case you decide to reactivate, or as needed to comply with legal obligations (such as maintaining records of transactions for tax/audit purposes). If you delete your account, we will remove or anonymize personal data associated with your account within a reasonable timeframe, except as noted below. - Content you upload is retained until you delete it or your account is deleted. If you remove specific files or pages, we will delete them from our active systems, though they may remain in our backups for a short period. Backups are purged on a rolling schedule. - Information collected from people who downloaded content (subscribers) is generally retained to provide to the creator and for our analytics (in aggregate form). If you are a content subscriber and you want us to delete your information, you should contact the creator who collected it or contact us at privacy@sharekit.net so we can assist (we may remove or anonymize your data from our systems, but the creator may still have it in their own storage). - If you unsubscribe from marketing emails, we will keep your email on a suppression list to ensure we don’t contact you when you’ve asked us not to. - We retain logs and security records as needed – typically, web server logs might be kept for a few weeks or months, and security audit logs for a bit longer, in case of investigating incidents. - When we no longer have a legitimate need or legal obligation to keep your data, we will securely delete or anonymize it.
Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction and the applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. We are committed to honoring those rights. These may include:
* Access and Portability: You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you, and to obtain it in a readily usable format. For example, ShareKit users can request an export of their account data. End-users who submitted info through a ShareKit form can also contact us to request what information we have (though, often it will be just what you gave us).
* Correction (Rectification): If any of your personal details are inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct them. You can do this yourself for basic profile info by logging into your account settings. For other data, contact us.
* Deletion (Erasure): You can request that we delete your personal information. For account owners, you can usually delete your account which triggers deletion of data as described above. Subscribers who want their data removed from a creator’s list should contact the creator first, but you can also contact us and we will do our best to remove your information from our systems (which will prevent further contact via our platform). Note that we may need to retain certain information for legal reasons or internal business reasons (we will tell you if so).
* Objection to Processing: You may have the right to object to certain types of processing, such as processing for direct marketing or when we rely on legitimate interests. For example, you can opt out of marketing emails (as described below). If you object to other processing (like analytics tracking), you can use browser settings or plugins to block it, or contact us with specific concerns.
* Restriction of Processing: You can request that we restrict processing of your data in certain situations – for instance, while we verify your data correction request or in lieu of deletion (if you prefer we keep data but not use it further).
* Withdrawal of Consent: If we are processing your personal data based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. For example, if you gave consent to receive newsletters, you can withdraw by unsubscribing. Withdrawing consent won’t affect the lawfulness of processing done prior to withdrawal.
* California Residents (CCPA/CPRA): If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including the right to know what categories of personal information we collect and for what purposes, the right to access specific pieces of information, the right to deletion (subject to similar exceptions), the right to correct inaccurate information, and the right to opt-out of “sale” or “sharing” of personal information. ShareKit does not sell personal information as defined by CCPA, and we don’t share it for cross-context behavioral advertising. If that ever changes, we will implement a “Do Not Sell or Share” link. You also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights. To exercise your California rights, you can contact us as described below. We will verify your request (usually by confirming information we have on file like your email address).
* GDPR (EEA, UK, etc.): If you are in the European Economic Area, UK, or similar jurisdictions, our legal basis for processing your info is typically: (i) your consent (e.g., for optional cookies or for us processing subscriber data on your behalf), (ii) performance of a contract (providing our service to you as a user), or (iii) our legitimate interests (for things like improving our service, preventing fraud – we balance these interests against your data protection rights). You also have the rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, and portability as listed above. You additionally have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority (DPA) if you believe our processing is unlawful. We encourage you to reach out to us first so we can address your concerns.
To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at privacy@sharekit.net with your request. We may need to verify your identity (to ensure we’re giving access or making changes to the correct person’s data). We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by law (for example, under GDPR, typically within one month; under CCPA, within 45 days, etc.), and we will let you know if we need more information or time.
Opting Out of Emails: If you no longer want to receive our newsletters or marketing communications, you can opt out at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in those emails or by adjusting your account email preferences if that feature exists. Note that you will still receive transactional and service-related emails (like account notifications, password resets, and essential updates) even if you opt out of marketing, as those are necessary for using the service.
Do Not Track: Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature that, when enabled, signals to websites that you do not want to be tracked across sites. Currently, our Platform does not respond to DNT signals in a standardized way, because there is no consensus in the industry on how to interpret them. However, we treat all users’ data with the same high level of respect and offer the controls described in this Policy (like cookie controls and opting out of analytics to the extent possible).
Data Security
ShareKit is committed to protecting your information. We implement a variety of technical and organizational security measures to safeguard personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These measures include: - Encryption: We use encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) for all communications between your browser and our servers, which protects data from eavesdropping. We encourage you to check for the padlock in your browser address bar when using ShareKit. We also encrypt sensitive data at rest where appropriate. For example, passwords are stored hashed (not in plain text), and any payment information is stored by our payment processor in accordance with PCI-DSS standards. - Access Controls: We restrict access to personal data to authorized personnel who need it to operate or improve our service. Our team members and contractors are bound by confidentiality obligations. We employ role-based access so that, for instance, a support agent might see your account email to help you, but they won’t have access to plaintext passwords or payment info. We also require two-factor authentication for our own administrative access to critical systems. - Monitoring and Testing: We regularly monitor our systems for vulnerabilities and attacks. We keep our software and dependencies up to date with security patches. We may run periodic security audits and assessments, and we maintain an incident response plan. In the event of a data breach involving your personal information, we will notify you and the relevant authorities as required by law. - Physical Security: Our data is stored in secure data centers managed by reputable providers (like the cloud infrastructure mentioned earlier). These facilities have their own robust physical security controls (guarded entrances, surveillance, etc.). While we don’t operate our own physical servers, we rely on the security of these cloud providers which meet industry standards. - Employee Training: We train our staff about the importance of data privacy and security. We ensure that those with access to personal data are aware of their responsibilities to protect it.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security. You should also play a part in protecting your data: keep your password confidential and do not share it. If you believe your account has been compromised, please change your password immediately and contact us if you need assistance.
International Data Transfers
ShareKit is based in the United States. If you are using our service from outside the U.S., be aware that your personal information will likely be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States (and possibly other countries where our service providers are located). Data protection laws in these countries may differ from those in your jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that adequate protections are in place for your data in accordance with applicable legal requirements. For example, for data coming from the European Economic Area (EEA) or UK to the U.S., we may rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or other approved transfer mechanisms to ensure an equivalent level of protection as in the EU (if we are subject to GDPR rules). By using ShareKit or submitting your information to us, you understand that your data may be transferred to our facilities and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.
Third-Party Links and Services
Our Platform may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated by us. For example, a creator’s landing page might include a link to their personal website or a payment page; or our own site might link to a blog on Medium, our social media pages, or integration partners. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on those external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party site you visit or service you use.
Additionally, if a ShareKit creator uses third-party integrations (for example, embedding a widget on the landing page, or exporting data to another platform), your interactions might involve those third parties. We strive to minimize such exposures within our platform. We will clearly inform you if any part of our service involves giving data to a third party beyond what’s described here.
Children’s Privacy
ShareKit is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for ShareKit or send us any personal information. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 13 has provided personal information to ShareKit, please contact us at privacy@sharekit.net so we can delete the child’s information. (For teens between 13 and 18, we recommend parental supervision, and such users should only use the Platform with a parent/guardian’s consent where required by law.)
If our Platform in the future offers any features targeted at a younger audience (which is not our plan), we will implement appropriate measures in accordance with laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, and other factors. When we do, we will post the updated policy on our site and update the “Last Updated” date at the top. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as by email notification to users or a banner on our website) before the changes take effect, as required by law. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of ShareKit after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.
If we were to use your personal information in a manner materially different from what was stated at the time of collection, we will endeavor to notify you in advance and, if required, obtain your consent.
Contact Us
If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us:
* Email: privacy@sharekit.net
* Mail: ShareKit, Inc. – Privacy Office, 1234 Main Street, Omaha, NE 68102, USA (Use the actual business mailing address here.)
* Website Contact: You may also reach out via our support/contact form on the ShareKit website.
We will do our best to address and resolve any privacy issues you may have. If you are not satisfied with our response, and applicable law allows, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (for example, an EU resident can contact their country’s DPA).
Thank you for trusting ShareKit with your content and your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a secure, reliable service for all our users.

DMCA Policy
Last Updated: November 11, 2025
ShareKit respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable laws, it is our policy to respond expeditiously to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement on the ShareKit platform. This DMCA Policy outlines how copyright owners can properly notify us of claimed infringements, how alleged infringing users can respond with a counter-notification if they believe content was removed in error, and our policy for repeat infringers.
Please note: ShareKit is a platform that hosts user-uploaded content (digital files and resources shared by creators). We operate as an online service provider under the DMCA (17 U.S.C. § 512). If you are a copyright owner and you find content on ShareKit that you believe infringes your copyrighted work, follow the steps below to submit a takedown notice. If you are a user who has received a notification that your content was removed due to a DMCA notice, you have the right to submit a counter-notice as described below.
Filing a DMCA Takedown Notice (For Copyright Owners)
If you are the owner of a copyright (or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf), and you believe that any content on ShareKit infringes your copyright, you may submit a DMCA Takedown Notice to request removal of the allegedly infringing material. Your notice must be in writing and include all of the following information in order to be effective (this is required by 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3)):
1. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed: Provide a description of the copyrighted work that you own or represent that you believe has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works are involved, you can provide a representative list. For example, “the book entitled [Book Name] by [Author], especially the text from pages X–Y” or “several photographs from [Website].”
2. Identification of the infringing material and its location: Identify the specific content on our Platform that you claim is infringing, and provide reasonably sufficient information to locate it. The best way is to include the direct URL to the page or file on ShareKit. For instance, provide the URL of the landing page where the file is accessible or the direct link to the file if known. If the content was delivered via email (like a download link), describe it and any info that can help us locate the material in our system. The more detail you provide, the faster we can find and remove it[16].
3. Your contact information: Include your full name (and company name if applicable), mailing address, telephone number, and email address. We need to be able to reach you to communicate about the notice. Preferably, also include the email or phone number that you would consent to have communicated to the user who uploaded the content, in case they want to contact you or send a counter-notice (this is legally required when we forward counter notices).
4. A statement of good faith: Include a statement such as: “I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”[5]. This is a statutory requirement and indicates that you truly believe this use is not legally permissible (for example, not fair use or licensed).
5. A statement regarding the accuracy of your notice and authority: Include a statement along the lines of: “The information in this notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I affirm that I am the owner of the copyright or I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”[17]. This means you swear that you are telling the truth and that you have the right to submit this claim.
6. Your signature: The notice must be signed. If you are sending the notice electronically, an electronic signature is acceptable. You can simply type your full legal name at the end of the notice to serve as your electronic signature, or attach a scanned signature. If you are mailing/faxing a physical notice, include an actual signature.
Once you have gathered the above information, send your DMCA Takedown Notice to our designated Copyright Agent. We accept DMCA notices by email for the fastest response:
Designated DMCA Agent:
Email: dmca@sharekit.net
Subject line: “DMCA Takedown Notice”
Alternate Contact (Physical Mail):
ShareKit, Inc. – DMCA Agent
1234 Main Street, Omaha, NE 68102, USA (Attn: Legal Department)
(If sending by mail, we recommend also emailing a copy for quicker action.)
Important: Only send DMCA notices to the contact information above. General support or abuse reports should go to our support email. Misusing the DMCA (such as sending false claims) can have legal consequences – including potential liability for damages and attorneys’ fees. Under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any person who knowingly misrepresents that material is infringing may be subject to liability. So please ensure you are the rightful copyright owner or authorized agent and that you have a good-faith belief in your claim.
What Happens Next (After You Send a Notice)
When ShareKit receives a properly formatted DMCA Takedown Notice, we will: - Acknowledge receipt: We will typically reply to let you know we got your notice and will be acting on it. - Review and Remove: We will review the identified content and, if your notice is valid, expeditiously remove or disable access to the alleged infringing material. For example, if it’s a file, we may take down or block the file; if it’s a landing page, we might disable the page or remove the infringing content on it. - Notify the user: We will make a good-faith attempt to contact the user who uploaded the content to inform them that we’ve removed or disabled access to their content due to a DMCA claim[18]. We will provide the user with a copy of your DMCA notice (which will include your name, contact information, and the details of your claim, but typically not your signature). This is required by the DMCA. - Counter-notice option: We will inform the user of their right to submit a DMCA Counter Notification if they believe the removal is mistaken or that they have the right to use the content (see the Counter Notice section below).
We will also document the notice and our actions. In some cases, we may send a copy of your notice to third-party databases or clearinghouses (like the Lumen database) that track DMCA notices[19], as part of efforts to promote transparency (Mozilla’s policy does this, and we reserve the right to do similarly).
Please note: If you materially misrepresent that content on ShareKit is infringing, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees). If you’re unsure whether the material infringes your copyright (for example, whether it is fair use), you may wish to seek legal advice before filing a notice.
Filing a DMCA Counter Notification (For ShareKit Users)
If you are a ShareKit user (content creator) and you receive a notification that your content was removed or disabled due to a DMCA Takedown Notice, and you believe this removal was mistaken or that you have legal rights to the content, you can send us a DMCA Counter Notification to request the content be reinstated.
A Counter Notification must be a written communication from you to ShareKit’s DMCA Agent that includes all of the following elements (per 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(3)):
1. Identification of the material removed: Specify the content that was removed or disabled and the location where it appeared before removal. Ideally, mention the ShareKit URL or the specific resource name that was taken down[6]. For example, “File named XYZ that was available at [your landing page URL]” or “the image that was on [specific page link].” We need to know what we’re potentially restoring.
2. Statement under penalty of perjury of mistaken removal: Include a statement such as: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”[20] In other words, you assert that the content was wrongly removed – for instance, because you believe it is not infringing, or you have permission, or it’s your own original content, etc.
3. Your contact information: Provide your full name, address, and telephone number[21]. (Email is good too, and we likely have it from your account, but include it for completeness.)
4. Consent to jurisdiction: Include a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (if in the U.S.), or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial district in which ShareKit may be found (which would likely be the District of Nebraska, since we are based in Nebraska, USA). Also state that you will accept service of process from the person who submitted the DMCA Takedown Notice or their agent[22]. For example: “I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if outside the United States, the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska, and I will accept service of process from the claimant.”
5. Your signature: You must sign the Counter Notification. An electronic signature (typing your name) is acceptable if you send via email. Make sure it’s clear that it’s a signature.
Send the completed Counter Notification to our designated DMCA Agent (contact info provided above for notices: dmca@sharekit.net). Use a subject like “DMCA Counter Notification” for clarity.
What Happens After a Counter Notification
When we receive a valid Counter Notification, we will: - Forward a copy of the Counter Notification to the original complainant (the person who sent the DMCA Takedown Notice). - Inform them that we will replace the removed content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days unless we first receive notice from the complainant that they have filed a court action seeking an order to keep the content down[7]. - In other words, once the original copyright claimant gets your counter notice, the ball is in their court: if they want to prevent the content from being restored, they need to file a lawsuit against you in that 10-business-day window (and provide us proof, such as a court filing stamp or case number). - If we do not receive notice of a court action within 10 business days after forwarding your counter notice, we will, promptly thereafter, restore the material that was removed or re-enable access to it. This typically occurs between day 10 and day 14 after the counter notice (allowing a little buffer). - We will notify you when the content is reinstated. If we do receive notice of a legal action, we will not restore the content, and the matter will have to be resolved by the courts.
Please be aware that filing a false Counter Notification (for example, if you actually were infringing) could have legal consequences. The statement you provide is under penalty of perjury, meaning it’s a sworn declaration. Only file a counter notice if you truly believe the content was removed in error or that you are legally entitled to post it (like you have the copyright, a license, or a valid fair use argument). If you’re unsure, consult an attorney.
Repeat Infringer Policy
In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, ShareKit has a policy to terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers. A repeat infringer is typically a user who has been the subject of multiple valid DMCA takedown notices. Specifically: - If a user receives two or more separate DMCA complaints that result in confirmed infringements (i.e., we removed content and the user didn’t successfully counter or the counter was overridden by court action), we will consider that user a repeat infringer. We reserve the right to terminate that user’s account and bar them from using the Platform. In clear cases (like a user blatantly uploading pirated content regularly), we may terminate after a single incident if circumstances warrant (for example, a single DMCA notice that involves a large volume of infringing works might prompt account termination). - We maintain an internal log of DMCA notices and counter notices to track repeat offenses. Termination is at our discretion but will be enforced consistently to comply with the law. - If your account is terminated under this policy, you are prohibited from creating a new account or accessing the Platform without express permission.
We aim to balance the rights of copyright owners and our users. We understand mistakes can happen; that’s why the counter-notice process exists. But clear violations and repeated abuse of ShareKit for infringing purposes will not be tolerated.
Misuse of the DMCA
We take DMCA notices seriously. Do not send fraudulent or bad-faith copyright complaints. Submitting a false claim (like pretending to be a copyright owner when you are not, or claiming someone else’s legitimate content infringes your copyright when it doesn’t) can lead to legal consequences for you, including liability for damages, court costs, and attorneys’ fees under Section 512(f) of the DMCA[23]. The same goes for users sending false counter notices. Both parties should ensure their claims are truthful and made in good faith.
ShareKit reserves the right to ignore notices that fail to comply with the DMCA’s requirements or are otherwise defective. For example, if a notice doesn’t have all the required info, we might ask for clarification or treat it as insufficient. We also reserve the right to publish or share copies of infringement notices (with personal contact info redacted, except for what’s necessary to forward to the user) as mentioned, to educate others or for transparency.

Acceptable Use Policy
Last Updated: November 11, 2025
This Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) sets forth the rules and standards for using the ShareKit platform and services. We ask all users of ShareKit (including content creators and anyone accessing content through ShareKit) to adhere to both the letter and spirit of this policy to ensure a safe, lawful, and positive experience for everyone. By using ShareKit, you agree to comply with this AUP. Violations of this policy may lead to suspension or termination of your account and/or access to the Platform, removal of content, and other consequences as deemed appropriate by ShareKit.
1. Lawful and Permitted Use Only
ShareKit is intended to be used for lawful purposes only. You may not use ShareKit in any manner that violates any applicable law, regulation, or rule. This includes all local, state, national, and international laws that may apply to your use of our service. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Platform is in compliance with laws applicable to you and your content (for example, intellectual property laws, privacy and data protection laws, export control laws, etc.).
You may use the Platform only in accordance with our Terms of Service, this Policy, and any guidelines or documentation we provide. If you are unsure whether something is permitted, please err on the side of caution or contact us for clarification.
2. Prohibited Content and Activities
You are strictly prohibited from using ShareKit to create, upload, store, transmit, distribute, or facilitate content or activities that fall into any of the following categories:
* Illegal Activities: Any use of ShareKit for unlawful purposes is prohibited. You may not use the service to promote, facilitate, or engage in criminal or fraudulent activities. This includes but is not limited to: selling or distributing illegal goods or services, schemes to defraud, dealing in regulated materials (like drugs or weapons) without proper authorization, or instructions for illegal activities (e.g., bomb-making, hacking tools for illegal purposes).
* Infringing Content: Do not upload or share content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others. This means no unauthorized use of copyrighted material, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, or other proprietary content. Examples: sharing ebooks, music, videos, or software that you don’t have rights to; using someone else’s logos or brand names in a confusing way. You must have the necessary rights, licenses, or permissions for all content you upload. (See our DMCA Policy for how copyright issues are handled.)[24][23]
* Piracy and Circumvention: You may not use ShareKit to distribute pirated content or tools that circumvent copyright protection. For example, no linking to torrent files of copyrighted media, no hacking tools, cracks, keygens, or similar.
* Malicious Code and Security Violations: It is forbidden to upload or transmit viruses, malware, or any other malicious code that could harm or disrupt the operation of ShareKit or others’ devices. You also must not engage in any activities that undermine the security or integrity of our systems, such as:
* Attempting to gain unauthorized access to ShareKit or other accounts, systems, or networks (e.g., hacking, scanning, or probing for vulnerabilities).
* Launching any form of network attack or interference (e.g., denial-of-service attacks, distributing malware).
* Using the Platform to test or reverse engineer our software in order to find limitations or vulnerabilities (outside of a permissible security testing program, if one exists).
* Impersonating headers, IP addresses, or packet information to deceive or mask your usage (e.g., forging TCP/IP packet headers, email headers, or any part of a message intended to disguise the origin).
* Spam and Unsolicited Communications: ShareKit strictly prohibits using our service for spam or unsolicited bulk messages. You may not use ShareKit to send any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of duplicative or unsolicited messages.
* If you are collecting email addresses via ShareKit, you must ensure that those individuals have consented to receive the type of communications you plan to send.
* You must comply with applicable email laws like the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act (e.g., include proper sender info and an easy way to opt-out)[9] and other anti-spam/marketing regulations in your region.
* Any attempt to harvest or scrape information (like email addresses) from ShareKit for spamming purposes is prohibited.
* Harassment and Hateful Content: You may not use ShareKit to harass, bully, or defame individuals or groups. Content that is defamatory, libelous, or that constitutes unlawful harassment or stalking is prohibited. Additionally, hate speech is absolutely not allowed. Hate speech includes content that attacks or demeans a group or individual based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected class. We have zero tolerance for content that promotes or glorifies violence, hatred, or discrimination against any group.
* Obscene or Pornographic Material: ShareKit is not a platform for pornography or sexually explicit content. Do not upload or share pornography or extremely explicit sexual content. In particular, any content depicting minors in any sexual context is strictly forbidden and will be reported to authorities. Also disallowed is bestiality or rape content, or any content that is excessively graphic. Non-pornographic adult content (e.g., educational health content) should be shared privately and appropriately labeled, but if in doubt, do not use ShareKit for this content.
* Nudity in an artistic, educational, or non-sexual context may be tolerated on a limited basis if it is not pornographic (but since ShareKit’s focus is professional content sharing, such content is rarely appropriate here).
* Violent or Graphic Content: Do not share content that is extremely violent, gory, or graphic solely for the sake of being shocking or disturbing. Content that encourages or glorifies violence is also prohibited (e.g., support for terrorist organizations, instructions on violent wrongdoing, or praise of violent acts). Some graphic content in an educational or news context may be permissible (e.g., medical images, war documentary footage) but should be handled with caution and only when necessary.
* Harmful Misinformation: ShareKit should not be used to propagate deliberately false or harmful misinformation that could cause public harm. For example, false claims about health (e.g., disinformation about vaccines that could result in harm), fake news meant to incite panic or hatred, or scam information. While we do not generally monitor or fact-check content, if we receive reports of dangerous misinformation being shared, we reserve the right to take action.
* Personal Data Abuse / Doxxing: You may not share personal identifiable information (PII) of others without their consent. This includes addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security/national ID numbers, credit card details, or any sensitive personal data. “Doxxing” (posting someone’s personal information to harass or encourage others to harass) is strictly forbidden. If your ShareKit content involves any collection of personal data (like asking users to fill forms), you must have a legitimate purpose and follow privacy laws (see Privacy Policy).
* Impersonation and Deceptive Conduct: Do not impersonate any person or organization or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or organization when using ShareKit. You should not use ShareKit for phishing or attempting to trick others into revealing sensitive information. Creating pages or content that falsely appear to be from someone else (like using a company’s logo without permission to scam people) is prohibited. Any kind of fraud, scam, or deceptive scheme (e.g., “get rich quick” scams, fake investment opportunities, false advertising) is not allowed.
* Excessive or Disruptive Use: While we want you to use ShareKit fully, using it in a manner that excessively burdens our infrastructure or disrupts the normal use of the service for others is prohibited. This could include:
* Running excessive automation or high-volume requests (like using bots to rapidly create accounts or upload content en masse, beyond what is needed).
* Attempting to circumvent rate limits, storage limits, or other usage restrictions that we impose.
* Hosting large files unrelated to the service’s intent (e.g., using ShareKit purely as personal cloud storage for huge video files that are not being shared as resources, etc. – we are not an illicit file-sharing depot).
* If we provide an API or integration, abiding by any API usage guidelines is required.
* Reselling or Unauthorized Commercial Use: You may not resell the ShareKit services or use it as a white-label service without permission. For example, you shouldn’t create a competing service by wrapping or rebranding ShareKit for others. You may not use ShareKit for purposes of competitive analysis, benchmarking, or to develop a competing product or service explicitly copying ShareKit’s features (reverse engineering beyond what’s allowed in Terms). Also, you cannot sublicense or provide “accounts” to ShareKit to people outside your organization as a paid service (if you are some intermediary) without our consent.
* Other Unacceptable Behavior: In general, if an activity is unethical, disruptive, or likely to pose harm to ShareKit or its users, it’s probably disallowed. This includes any attempts to abuse the platform’s features in unintended ways or any content that could be reasonably seen as inappropriate in a professional content-sharing environment.
3. Examples of Allowed Content/Use
To clarify, here are examples of content and usage that are generally allowed on ShareKit, as long as they comply with the above rules: - Sharing of original digital resources that you created, such as PDF guides, e-books, checklists, templates, or presentations, provided you own the rights (or have permission) to all content within them. - Educational content, tutorials, and informational resources, including ones that might discuss mature topics in a responsible way (e.g., a health guide that references anatomy with illustrations). - Business and marketing materials that you have the right to use, such as your own case studies, whitepapers, or portfolio pieces. - Public domain or open-license content, as long as it truly is under an appropriate license (e.g., a compilation of tips that includes quotes or snippets from public domain works, or a guide that includes a Creative Commons-licensed image with proper credit). - Honest and constructive content, even if critical. (For instance, a consultant’s report analyzing a company or policy critically is okay as long as it’s not veering into defamation or hate.) - Soliciting sign-ups or leads in a legitimate manner (e.g., “Sign up with your email to get my free guide”), as long as you then respect their consent and communication preferences thereafter. - Creative works like short stories, music, or art that you wish to distribute for free or sale, provided you own the rights or have permission. (E.g., sharing your own photography portfolio PDF is fine.) - Incidental or minimal use of third-party content as allowed by law (for example, quoting a paragraph from a book for critique under fair use, or including a reference image under a license) – this can be tricky, but minor uses with attribution might be acceptable; users should ensure their use is truly lawful.
When in doubt about content, consider whether it could harm someone, violate someone’s rights, or break a law. If yes or maybe, it likely shouldn’t be on ShareKit.
4. Enforcement and Consequences
ShareKit reserves the right to monitor (though we do not pre-screen all material) and to investigate any violation of this Acceptable Use Policy or misuse of our services. We may: - Remove or disable access to content that violates this policy or our Terms, without prior notice. - Suspend or terminate accounts or access: If you violate this AUP, we may suspend your account’s functionality (e.g., temporarily disable sharing or uploading) or terminate your account entirely. Minor first-time issues might get a warning, but serious or intentional violations can result in immediate termination. - Report to authorities: If the content or misuse involves illegal activities, especially concerning child exploitation, threats of violence, or other serious crimes, we will report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities[25]. We will cooperate with law enforcement as legally required. - Charge for costs or pursue legal action: If your actions cause us to incur losses (for example, due to spam blacklisting, legal fines, or damage to our systems), we reserve the right to seek compensation. Misuse of the system might also lead to civil or criminal liability for you. - Filter or block content: In some cases, we may implement technical measures to prevent the hosting or transmission of prohibited content (for example, scanning for viruses or known illegal files). - Contact you: We may reach out to you to educate or warn you if your content is approaching a boundary (in some cases content might be unintentional violation or a gray area; we’ll try to advise if possible rather than just penalize).
Decisions by ShareKit’s staff in enforcing this AUP are final. We will make good-faith efforts to be fair and consistent, but we have the discretion to determine what constitutes a violation in ambiguous cases. This AUP does not require us to take action in every instance; our non-enforcement of any part of this policy in some cases is not a waiver of our rights.
If you believe that a user of ShareKit is violating this AUP, please report it to us at abuse@sharekit.net or through any provided reporting mechanism. Include as much detail as possible (links, descriptions, screenshots). We will review the report and take appropriate action.
5. Updates to this Policy
We may update this Acceptable Use Policy from time to time as our services and the legal landscape evolve. When we make changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top. For significant changes, we may provide additional notice (such as via email or a notice on our website). Your continued use of ShareKit after any changes to this AUP constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy. If you do not agree with the changes, you should discontinue use of the platform.
6. Questions
If you have any questions or need clarification about whether something is allowed, feel free to contact our support at support@sharekit.net before proceeding. We’d much rather help you understand the rules than have you inadvertently violate them.
By using ShareKit, you agree to this Acceptable Use Policy. Thank you for helping us maintain a platform that is safe, legal, and respectful for our community.

Legal Disclaimers
Last Updated: November 11, 2025
The following legal disclaimers are provided by ShareKit to clarify certain responsibilities and limitations of liability regarding the use of our Platform. These disclaimers apply to the fullest extent permitted by law and are intended to supplement (not replace) the provisions in our Terms of Service. By using ShareKit, you acknowledge and agree to these disclaimers:
1. “As-Is” Service and No Warranty
ShareKit (the Platform and all its services, features, and content) is provided to you “as is” and “as available,” without any warranty of any kind. This means that we do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or perfectly suited to your needs. Use ShareKit at your own risk.
We specifically disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to: - Implied Warranties of Merchantability & Fitness: We make no implied promise that ShareKit is fit for a particular purpose or merchantable. For example, we don’t guarantee that using ShareKit will result in any particular outcome for your business or that it will meet your specific expectations. - Non-Infringement: While we require users to only upload content they have rights to, we do not warrant that any content on the Platform (user-uploaded or otherwise) does not infringe the rights of a third party. (However, we do take action when properly notified of infringement — see DMCA Policy.) - Accuracy & Reliability: We do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through ShareKit. This includes statistics, analytics, or content provided by users. Any reliance on such information is at your own discretion.
For example, if a coach shares a checklist via ShareKit, we are not warranting that the advice in that checklist is accurate or effective. The presence of content on our Platform does not constitute our endorsement or guarantee of its quality or truth.
ShareKit does not warrant that the Platform will be available at any given time or location, or that it is free from viruses or other harmful components (though we do take measures against these). If you download any material from ShareKit (like a PDF or other resource), you do so at your own discretion and risk. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from such downloads.
To summarize: We provide a tool for sharing content, but we don’t make promises beyond that. No advice or information (oral or written) obtained from us or through the service shall create any warranty not expressly stated here. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of these disclaimers may not fully apply to you – but in such cases, our warranties are limited to the minimum scope permitted by law.
2. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances will ShareKit, its owners, directors, officers, employees, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Platform[10]. This includes, but is not limited to, damages for: - Lost profits or revenue, - Loss of data, - Loss of goodwill, business interruption, or other intangible losses, - The cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, - Any content obtained through the service (e.g., if a file you download has errors or causes issues).
This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. For example, if ShareKit is down at a critical moment and you lose a client or an opportunity, or if someone uses your ShareKit link in a way that harms you, we will not be liable for those damages.
Furthermore, our maximum aggregate liability to you for all claims arising from your use of ShareKit will not exceed the greater of (a) the total amount you paid to us for the service in the last twelve (12) months, or (b) $100 USD[11]. If you have paid us nothing, our liability is capped at $100. This cap is an overall limit, meaning it applies to all claims combined, not per incident.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you in those places. In those cases, our liability is limited to the smallest amount permitted by law.
Important: We are not liable for the content you or any other user uploads, nor for any actions taken regarding content (removal, blocking, etc.). We provide tools and hosting; the users are responsible for their content.
3. User Content Responsibility
All content that users upload or share via ShareKit is the sole responsibility of the user who provides it[2]. ShareKit does not create, endorse, or guarantee the accuracy or legality of user content. We do not routinely screen content before it’s posted. Therefore: - We are not liable for any claims arising from user content, whether those claims are for defamation, intellectual property infringement, privacy violations, or otherwise. For example, if a creator shares a PDF with incorrect health advice and someone relies on it and is harmed, that is strictly between the creator and the individual; ShareKit is not responsible for the content or consequences. - We do not guarantee that user content will be of any particular quality or that it will meet any expectations. Downloaders should exercise their own judgment before relying on or using any content obtained through ShareKit. - If you as a user upload content, you must ensure it complies with our policies and the law. You will be responsible for any legal issues that arise from your content. If ShareKit suffers any loss because of your content (for example, if we get sued or fined due to something you uploaded), you may be required to compensate us (see Indemnification clause in Terms of Service).
In short: We are just the intermediary. We provide the platform for you to share or access content, but what’s in that content is up to the user who provided it. If you see content that violates our policies or your rights, please report it, and we will address it (e.g., via our DMCA Policy or content removal procedures), but until it’s brought to our attention and we act, that content is the user’s responsibility, not ours.
4. No Professional Advice Provided by ShareKit
Any information or content presented on the ShareKit site (including any help articles, blog posts, or user-uploaded content) is for general informational purposes only. ShareKit is not in the business of providing legal, financial, medical, or other professional advice to users. Nothing on our Platform constitutes professional advice by ShareKit.
If you obtain a resource via ShareKit (for example, a tax prep checklist from an accountant, or a fitness guide from a trainer), you should understand that: - ShareKit has not vetted or verified the professional qualifications of the content provider. - ShareKit does not guarantee that following any advice given in user content will lead to any particular result or that it’s suitable for your situation. - If you need professional advice, you should consult a qualified professional rather than relying solely on materials obtained through an online platform.
Similarly, any guidance we provide about our service (like how to better use ShareKit, or how to create engaging content) is general in nature and provided as-is, without warranty. It’s not a guarantee of success.
5. Third-Party Links and Integrations
ShareKit or user-created content on ShareKit might contain links to third-party websites or resources. We might also integrate with third-party services (for instance, an email provider or payment processor). ShareKit is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such external sites or resources, nor for the content, products, or services on or available from those third parties.
When you click on a third-party link or use a third-party service via ShareKit, you do so at your own risk. For example: - If a landing page shared via ShareKit links to a YouTube video or a personal website, and that site contains malware or misleading info, ShareKit isn’t liable. We didn’t create or host that external content. - If we integrate a payment gateway for selling content and there’s a dispute or error directly attributable to that gateway, you might be dealing with their terms and limitations, and our responsibility may be limited.
We do not endorse any third-party content or services that may appear in links or integrations. You should review the terms and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit or use.
6. Indemnity Reminder
While not exactly a “disclaimer,” it’s important to remember that by using ShareKit you have agreed (in the Terms of Service) to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your use, your content, or your violation of any laws or rights of others. This essentially means: - If your actions or content cause someone else to sue ShareKit or bring a claim against us, you will defend us and pay any judgment or settlement, as well as costs and attorney’s fees, assuming the claim arises from your breach of our terms or your wrongful conduct. This is how we shift potential liabilities to the responsible party. - For example, if you upload a document that infringes someone’s copyright and they sue us, you’d be expected to cover our costs and any losses because it was your action that caused the issue.
The indemnification clause is fully stated in our Terms of Service. By reiterating it here, we want to ensure users are fully aware of their responsibility for their own use of the Platform.
7. No Liability for Events Beyond Our Control
ShareKit will not be held responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performing, any of our obligations (including providing access to the Platform) if such failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. This can include events such as natural disasters, acts of government, war, civil unrest, strikes or labor disputes, internet or utility failures, or other force majeure events. Essentially, if something big and unforeseen happens that prevents us from running the service normally, we are not in breach of our obligations for that period.
8. Use at Your Own Risk
Using any online service, including ShareKit, comes with inherent risks. We work hard to mitigate risks (security measures, backups, etc.), but we cannot eliminate them all. By using ShareKit, you acknowledge that: - You are aware of and accept the risks of data loss. (We recommend keeping backup copies of important files you upload. We do backup our servers, but we cannot guarantee against loss of data.) - You accept the risk that information you share via ShareKit could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties (due to, say, a security breach or if you share your link widely and it falls into unintended hands). We secure our systems, but no system is perfectly secure. - You understand that any transactions facilitated through the Platform (like selling a resource to someone) are at your own risk. ShareKit is not responsible for buyer/seller disputes, fulfillment of promises outside of delivering the digital file, or refund obligations beyond what’s in our Refund Policy if it applies.
9. Jurisdictional Issues
We operate from the United States, and we make no representation that the content or the Platform is appropriate or available for use in all locations. Those who access ShareKit do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws. We disclaim liability for any user accessing the service in violation of any country’s laws or restrictions. If you’re in a region with strict internet or content laws, use ShareKit only as permitted by your local regulations.
Additionally, some jurisdictions have consumer protection laws that might confer you certain rights. Nothing in these disclaimers is intended to override rights you have as a consumer under law that cannot be waived. For example, in some places, certain warranties cannot be disclaimed for consumers. Our intention is to disclaim to the extent allowed, not beyond that.
10. Testimonials and Endorsements
If we ever display testimonials or success stories on our site (from users or customers), please understand those are individual experiences. They do not guarantee or even necessarily indicate typical results. Your experience may vary. ShareKit is not responsible for any loss or damage that might occur if your results differ from those in a testimonial.
We also sometimes might mention third-party services or products in our communications or site (like recommending an email tool or design software). Those are not endorsements; they are for informational purposes. We disclaim any liability for your use of third-party products we may mention in passing.
11. Future Changes
Finally, note that these disclaimers might be updated over time. Our goal is to clearly set expectations and protect ourselves from undue liability while being fair to users. We may modify or add to these disclaimers as needed (for example, if a new type of technology or integration introduces new common issues). We will notify users of material changes as appropriate, and continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of the updated disclaimers.

Cookie Policy
Last Updated: November 11, 2025
This Cookie Policy explains how ShareKit (“us”, “we”, or “our”) uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and platform. It should be read together with our Privacy Policy for a full understanding of how we handle personal data. By using ShareKit, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy (unless you disable them as explained below).
1. What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies allow the website to recognize your device and store certain information about your preferences or past actions.
There are different types of cookies: - Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you leave the site or close your browser. They help with things like remembering you as you navigate page to page (so you don’t get logged out unexpectedly, for example). - Persistent Cookies: These remain on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them. They can remember preferences or actions across multiple sessions (like keeping you logged in, or remembering your language preference on repeat visits). - First-party Cookies: Cookies set by the website you’re visiting (in this case, ShareKit). - Third-party Cookies: Cookies set by domains other than the website you’re visiting. For instance, if we embed a video from YouTube, YouTube might set its own cookie.
Cookies can also be categorized by their purpose: - Strictly Necessary Cookies - Functional/Preferences Cookies - Performance/Analytics Cookies - Targeting/Advertising Cookies
ShareKit primarily uses cookies in the first three categories and does not heavily rely on advertising cookies (since we are not an ad-supported platform). More details below.
2. How We Use Cookies
We use cookies and similar technologies (like local storage and pixels) for a variety of reasons: - Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential for the operation of our service. They enable core functionality such as user authentication, security, and network management. For example, when you log in to ShareKit, we use a session cookie (or session storage token) to keep you logged in as you navigate the dashboard. Without these cookies, the services you have asked for (like accessing your account or downloading a file you requested) cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet. - Examples: authentication tokens (so you don’t have to log in on every page), cookies that save your cookie consent preferences.
* Preferences Cookies: These cookies allow our site to remember choices you have made in the past, like what language you prefer, or other personalized settings. If our platform has adjustable settings, a cookie might store those so your experience is tailored.
* Example: If you choose a preferred landing page template or theme in your account, we might store that preference so your editing environment remembers it.
* Analytics and Performance Cookies: We want to understand how users use ShareKit so we can improve it. Analytics cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, which pages are visited most often, how users move around the site, error messages encountered, etc. These cookies help us improve the way our website works, make sure users find what they need easily, and generally enhance user experience.
* For instance, we may use Google Analytics or a similar tool. These tools set cookies to distinguish users (often by a randomly assigned ID) and to throttle request rates. The information collected is typically aggregated and anonymous – we look at trends overall, not at what a specific person is doing. We might see that “X% of users clicked on the ‘Start sharing’ button after visiting the homepage” or “The average time on a landing page edit screen is Y minutes.”
* We might also use these to track conversion metrics (like how many visitors to our marketing site sign up for the service).
* Analytics cookies on ShareKit might include ones set by our analytics provider (first-party or third-party). We strive to use reputable analytics providers that respect privacy (and where possible, we may anonymize IP addresses or honor “Do Not Track” if feasible).
* Security Cookies: Some cookies are used to ensure security, for example, to detect fraud or abuse of the website. They might store information about your session or requests that helps us identify malicious behavior. These often overlap with necessary cookies. For example, we might set a cookie or local storage value to help prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, ensuring that a form submission on our site actually came from you.
* Advertising Cookies: As of the latest update, ShareKit does not use first-party advertising cookies (we do not show third-party ads on our platform that would need such cookies). We also do not knowingly allow third-party advertising networks to set cookies through us for targeted advertising. If this ever changes (for example, if we start a referral program that involves cookies, or we advertise our own service on other platforms and want to measure it), we will update this section.
* However, if you click a ShareKit referral link or affiliate link on another site, a cookie might be set by that site or our site to attribute the referral. That’s not advertising in the sense of user profiling, but rather tracking the source of signups.
* Third-party Functionality: Sometimes we may incorporate content or functionality from third parties into our site, which might set cookies. Examples could be:
* Embedding a YouTube or Vimeo video on a ShareKit landing page preview (YouTube might set cookies to keep track of video views or preferences).
* If we provide a social media sharing widget (like a Facebook “share” button on our blog), those networks might set cookies.
* Using an A/B testing service to try different page layouts – it might set a cookie to remember which version you saw.
* Using a chat support widget (that little “help” bubble), which might use cookies to remember you have an open chat or your previous conversation.
We will endeavor to list major third-party cookies in an appendix below, but note that third-party providers may change their cookies and practices without always notifying us. In our Privacy Policy, we list our key service providers and you can refer to their privacy documentation for details on their cookie usage.
3. Cookies We Use
While the specific cookies used on ShareKit may change over time as we update our site and services, here are some typical cookies and their purposes (for illustrative purposes):
* sharekit_session (ShareKit) – A session cookie containing your session ID or token to keep you logged in. Expires when you log out or after a set short period of inactivity.
* XSRF-TOKEN (ShareKit) – A security cookie used to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. It ensures that form submissions or requests come from an authenticated user.
* language or locale (ShareKit) – Remembers the language or locale you selected (if our site is multilingual).
* sharekit_consented (ShareKit) – Remembers that you saw and closed the cookie banner or consented to cookies, so we don’t show the banner every time.
* _ga, _gid (Google Analytics) – These cookies are from Google Analytics. _ga is used to distinguish users and has a typical expiration of 2 years; _gid is another used to distinguish users with a 24-hour expiration[26]. These help count how many people visit our site, and how they use it, but do not directly identify individuals to us.
* _gat (Google Analytics) – Used to throttle request rate (to limit the collection of data on high traffic sites). Expires in 1 minute.
* sid (Supabase) – If we use Supabase’s auth or other features, they might set a cookie or local storage for session management.
* Stripe cookies (if applicable) – If ShareKit integrates Stripe for payments, Stripe may set its own cookies (like __stripe_mid and __stripe_sid for fraud prevention and identifying devices). These help detect suspicious payment behavior. They usually last for a few hours (sid) to longer (mid might last a year or two).
* Intercom-id-xxx (if we had Intercom for support) – Would identify your browser for support chats or user identification. (Just an example, not necessarily in use.)
* Vimeo or YouTube cookies – if a video is embedded and you play it, those platforms may set cookies like vuid (Vimeo) or VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE (YouTube) to track usage or preferences.
(The above is not an exhaustive list, but representative. We will update this section with any new significant cookies.)
4. Your Choices: Managing and Disabling Cookies
You have the right to choose whether to accept cookies. However, note that if you disable certain categories of cookies (especially the necessary ones), our website may not function properly. Here are ways you can manage cookies:
* Browser Settings: Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can usually:
* Clear all cookies or cookies from a specific site.
* Block cookies (all or just third-party cookies).
* See what cookies are set and selectively delete them.
* Set your browser to notify you when cookies are being used.
Each browser is a little different. You can find information about cookie settings for various browsers here: - Google Chrome: (see Chrome’s official site for managing cookies) - Mozilla Firefox: (see Firefox help on cookies) - Safari (Desktop): (Apple’s guide on managing cookies) - Safari (Mobile iOS): (for Safari on iPhone/iPad) - Microsoft Edge: (Edge’s cookie settings) - etc.
Setting your browser to reject cookies is a broad approach. If you choose to do this for ShareKit, remember that things like login sessions may not persist and you might have a degraded experience. For instance, if you block all cookies, you might not be able to log in or download content, since the site won’t remember that you’re the authorized user from page to page.
* Cookie Banner/Consent Management: On your first visit to ShareKit, you might have seen a cookie notice (particularly if you are visiting from a jurisdiction where it’s required, like the EU). We allow you to accept or reject non-essential cookies. If you initially accepted but later change your mind, look for a “Cookie Settings” link on our site (often in the footer). Through that, you can adjust your preferences (e.g., disable analytics cookies). If there’s no self-service option visible, you can contact us and we can assist or instruct you how to opt out of certain cookies.
* Opting Out of Analytics:
* For Google Analytics, Google provides an opt-out browser add-on which you can install to prevent your data from being used by GA: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
* Alternatively, some analytics providers respect the “Do Not Track” setting in your browser. If you enable Do Not Track, we endeavor to configure our analytics to respect it where possible.
* We may also configure our analytics to anonymize IP addresses if required by law in some regions.
* Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising Cookies: While ShareKit doesn’t set advertising cookies, if you are concerned about them on the web in general:
* You can visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (for US) or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ (for EU) to opt out of interest-based advertising cookies from participating companies.
* Mobile Devices: On mobile apps (if ShareKit had a mobile app) different tracking might be used, but since we’re web-based, your mobile web browser settings handle cookies similarly to desktop.
Remember: any preferences are often browser-specific. If you use multiple browsers or devices, you’ll need to set your cookie choices on each.
Also note, if you clear all cookies, that may include an “opt-out cookie.” For instance, if you opted out of analytics via a cookie, deleting cookies will remove that preference and you might need to opt out again.
5. Cookies and Personal Data
Information collected by cookies may be considered personal data (for example, IP address or unique IDs in cookies can indirectly identify you). Our Privacy Policy describes how we use personal data, our legal basis, etc. Generally: - Necessary cookies are used based on our legitimate interest (or contractual necessity) to provide a working service. - Analytics cookies are used based on your consent (where required by law). We won’t drop them for users in consent-requiring jurisdictions unless you allow. - We respect privacy rights and attempt to minimize data. Analytics data is aggregated, and we do not attempt to identify individuals via analytics cookies.
We do not use cookies to track you across websites or build a profile of your browsing outside ShareKit.
We do not sell data collected by cookies to third parties. Third-party cookies that we allow (like Google Analytics) are used by those third parties to provide their service to us (e.g., aggregated analytics). Google may have access to the data their cookies collect; in Google Analytics, that means usage data of our site, which Google may combine with info from other sites you visit that also use GA to, for example, improve their services. For details, see Google’s own policies.
6. Updates to this Cookie Policy
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make significant changes, we will notify you (perhaps via a banner or email, consistent with how we handle changes in the Privacy Policy). The “Last Updated” date at the top indicates when it was last revised.
We encourage you to review this Cookie Policy periodically to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

Refund Policy
Last Updated: November 11, 2025
At ShareKit, we strive to deliver a valuable service and ensure our customers are satisfied. However, we understand that sometimes things don’t work out as expected. This Refund Policy outlines when we offer refunds for our services (primarily our subscription fees) and the process for requesting a refund. By using ShareKit and purchasing a subscription or any services from us, you agree to this Refund Policy.
1. Subscription Model and Charges
ShareKit operates on a subscription model for content creators (coaches, consultants, creators, etc.) who use our platform to share digital resources. Users may choose between free and paid plans. Paid plans typically involve a monthly or annual subscription fee, which provides access to premium features (such as higher limits, custom branding, advanced analytics, etc.). The specifics of our plans and pricing are described on our website or within the app.
All charges for paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring basis (e.g., you pay at the start of your monthly billing cycle for that month of access, or annually for the year). We may also offer one-time add-ons or usage-based charges in the future, but this policy primarily addresses subscription fees.
2. General Refund Policy
In general, fees for ShareKit services are non-refundable. This is common for SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) subscriptions, especially once services have been utilized. However, we do have some exceptions and special circumstances as outlined below. Our goal is to be fair and reasonable, so if you have a unique situation, please reach out to us.
* Monthly Subscriptions: We do not offer prorated refunds for unused time in the month if you decide to cancel mid-way. Once you’ve been billed for a month, you have access to the service until the end of that billing cycle, and then the subscription will not renew the next month if you canceled. For example, if you’re billed on the 1st of each month and you cancel on the 15th, you won’t receive a refund for the remaining days of the month, but you won’t be charged again after the 1st of the next month.
* Annual Subscriptions: Annual plans give a discount for committing for a year. As such, they are generally non-refundable after purchase, because you’ve secured a lower rate. If you cancel an annual plan, you will retain access until the end of the paid year, but it will not auto-renew the next year. In special cases (see below, such as early cancellation within a grace period or extenuating circumstances), we may consider a partial refund for the unused portion, but it is not our standard policy.
* Free Trials: If we offer a free trial period (say 14 days free, or a discounted first month), you will not be charged until the trial period ends. During the trial, you can cancel at any time and avoid any charge. Once the trial converts to a paid subscription, the above terms apply. Be mindful of trial expiration dates; we typically send a reminder, but it’s your responsibility to cancel if you don’t want to be charged.
* Promotional or First-Time Satisfaction Guarantee: If explicitly stated (for instance, on a promotion we might say “30-day money-back guarantee for first-time customers”), then we will honor that as described. Typically, that means if you are a brand new paying customer and within the first 30 days of using a paid plan you are unsatisfied, you can request a full refund of that first payment. We may ask for feedback (to understand what went wrong) but will process the refund if you meet the criteria (new customer, within the guarantee window). Such guarantees, if offered, will be clearly communicated at sign-up. If it’s not mentioned, assume we are not currently running a blanket money-back guarantee.
* Service Outages or Errors on Our Side: We recognize that if the Platform fails to provide the core service (for example, a prolonged outage or a technical bug that prevented you from using what you paid for), you deserve consideration. In cases where ShareKit’s systems had significant downtime or defects and you were unable to use the service as intended for a substantial period, please contact us. We may offer a credit or partial refund for the affected period, at our discretion. (For instance, if our site was down for a week, we might credit a quarter of that month’s fee to monthly subscribers, or extend an annual subscription by some days, etc.) We evaluate these on a case-by-case basis, but we aim to be fair and maintain trust.
* Incorrect Billing or Duplicate Charges: If you believe you were charged in error – for example, you were charged twice in one period, or charged after you canceled, or charged the wrong amount – please contact us immediately at billing@sharekit.net. If we verify an error on our end, we will of course refund the incorrect charge in full. (For instance, if a bug caused a double charge, we’ll refund the duplicate. Or if you canceled but the cancellation didn’t process and you got charged, we’ll refund that charge.)
* Extenuating Personal Circumstances: We understand that life can throw curveballs (serious illness, etc.). If you have a special circumstance that prevented you from using the service shortly after paying, reach out to us. While we cannot promise refunds beyond our policy, we will review such requests empathetically. We may offer a partial refund or credit for future use, especially if you hardly used the service due to those events. Documentation might be requested depending on the claim, but we handle these privately and sensitively.
* Account Termination for Violation: If your account is terminated by us due to your violation of our Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy (for example, you were using ShareKit for spamming or illegal content, etc.), you will not be eligible for a refund. In fact, per our terms, we reserve the right to terminate without refund in such cases. This is to prevent abuse (someone shouldn’t break the rules and then get their money back after we have to clean up the mess).
* Downgrades: If you downgrade your subscription plan (say from a Pro plan to a Basic plan), the change will usually take effect at the next billing cycle. You will continue on your higher plan until the end of the period you already paid for, and then renew at the lower plan rate. We do not typically refund the difference in price if you choose to downgrade mid-cycle, since you maintain access to the higher features until renewal. If you need the downgrade sooner, contact support – sometimes we can accommodate special requests, but generally no refunds for mid-cycle downgrade.
* Refund Payment Method: Refunds, when issued, will be made to the original payment method you used (e.g., the same credit card or bank). Please note that it might take some days for the refund to appear in your account (depending on your bank’s processing times). If the original method is unavailable (card expired, etc.), we’ll work with you on an alternative.
3. How to Request a Refund
If you believe you are entitled to or would like to request a refund, please follow these steps: 1. Contact Support: Email us at billing@sharekit.net or support@sharekit.net (or use any in-app support chat if available) with the subject “Refund Request”. Provide details including your account email, the charge in question (amount and date), and the reason you’re seeking a refund. 2. Timeframe for Requests: Ideally, request a refund as soon as possible after the charge (or issue) occurs. While we don’t set a hard deadline, requests that come in more than e.g. 60 days after a charge may be harder for us to evaluate or process (some payment processors have 90-day limits, etc.). If you were billed and didn’t notice for months, we reserve the right to deny a refund for older cycles, especially if the service was used. 3. Review: Our team will review your account usage, the timing, and the reason provided. We may reach out for additional information if needed. 4. Decision: We will inform you of the outcome. If approved, we will process the refund and let you know when it’s issued. If we decline, we will provide a brief explanation. (For example, “According to our logs, you continued to use the service heavily after the charge, so we cannot consider it unused” or “Your case falls outside our refund window.”) 5. Appeal: If you strongly disagree with a denial, you can reply and provide any additional context. We’ll escalate it internally for a second look. Our goal isn’t to fight with valued users – it’s to prevent abuse and ensure fairness.
We aim to handle refund requests promptly – usually within 5-7 business days for review, though the actual money return might take a bit longer depending on banks.
4. Chargebacks
We kindly ask that you contact us to resolve any billing issues before disputing a charge with your bank or card issuer. Filing a chargeback without first seeking a resolution with us can slow down the process (and in many cases is not necessary if a refund is justified – we’ll just give it). Also, unwarranted chargebacks (like forgetting you signed up and then disputing as “fraud”) can result in fees for us and potential termination of your account.
If we receive a chargeback notice for a transaction on your account, we will assume that you wish to cancel your service. We will investigate the situation. If the chargeback is in-process, we may suspend your account pending resolution (since a chargeback is effectively a forced refund). If it’s legitimate fraud (e.g., someone stole your card to pay us), we’ll cooperate with the investigation and obviously you’re not held to this policy – that’s between you and your bank, and we’ll mark that account for deletion.
However, if we find that a chargeback was filed in bad faith (for example, to circumvent our refund policy after using the service), we reserve the right to contest the chargeback with our evidence of your signup and usage. Additionally, we may terminate your account and refuse future service. This is a rare scenario – we only take such steps if we see clear abuse.
5. Refunds for End-Customers (Creators’ Audience)
This policy is primarily about ShareKit’s fees (what creators pay to use our platform). If you are someone who downloaded or purchased a product from a content creator via a ShareKit landing page (for instance, a creator charged you $5 for a PDF using our Stripe integration), ShareKit is not directly responsible for refunding you that money. The transaction is technically between you and the creator (with Stripe processing it). The creator should have their own refund policy for their products. You’ll need to contact the content creator for a refund of what you paid them.
However, if you have an issue and cannot reach the creator, you can notify us (support@sharekit.net). We do not guarantee a refund as we are not the seller of the content, but we may assist by reaching out to the creator, or in certain cases (like a clear scam and the creator disappeared) we might coordinate with the payment processor for next steps. Ultimately, though, our platform fee (if any) is separate from the product price you paid – we cannot just reverse the creator’s charge without their involvement unless it’s through proper dispute channels.
6. Cancellation vs. Refund
Remember, cancellation means you stop future billing. Refund means getting money back for a past charge. You can cancel anytime to stop the next billing; that does not automatically trigger a refund for the current period. This distinction is important.
To cancel your subscription: - You can usually do so in your Account Settings under “Billing” or “Plan” – click “Cancel Subscription” or “Downgrade to Free” if available. - Or email us at support@sharekit.net asking to cancel, and we’ll help. - When canceled, your account typically moves to the free tier at the end of the paid period. You can still use free features after that.
Cancelling ensures you won’t be charged again. If you cancel in the middle of a paid period, you won’t be refunded for that current period by default (as explained above), but you won’t be charged going forward.
If you cancel and later change your mind, you can resubscribe at any time (though the price and offerings at that time will apply).
7. Exceptions & Modifications
Any exceptions to this Refund Policy will be made at ShareKit’s sole discretion. This policy does not limit any of your statutory rights that may apply (for example, certain jurisdictions have laws about cooling-off periods or refunds for online purchases). Where such laws apply, we will honor them. For instance, EU consumers have a 14-day right of withdrawal for digital purchases under certain conditions – but by using the service immediately, often that right can be waived. We’ll abide by applicable consumer protection laws.
We may modify this Refund Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users (for instance via email or a notice in the dashboard). Policy changes will not apply retroactively to charges that occurred before the change; they’ll apply to future transactions.
8. Contact Us
If you have any questions or confusion about this Refund Policy or wish to discuss a specific situation, please contact our support team: - Email: support@sharekit.net (or billing@sharekit.net for billing-specific queries) - Contact Form: via our website’s contact page.
We aim to be understanding and helpful. Customer satisfaction is important to us, and we will work with you within the framework of this policy to reach a fair outcome.

By using ShareKit and paying for any services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Refund Policy.
